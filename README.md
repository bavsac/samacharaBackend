about the app

This is an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. This mimicks the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit). This should provide information to the front end architecture.

The database will be PSQL, and you will interact with it using [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

You will spend the setup and seeding phase of this project in a pair, and separate once its time to build the server up! The point to separate is clearly annotated :)
